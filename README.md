Before you start learning Python, it’s important to understand some of the basics. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

# Python is an interpreted language: 
- Unlike compiled languages like Java and C, Python doesn’t require a compilation step prior to running. Instead, Python source code files are used directly by a Python interpreter to execute 

# Python is object-oriented:
- but not exclusively. Python supports object-oriented programming, but you aren’t locked into it. You can add functions directly to a script when there isn’t a need for the overhead and complication of defining a class 

# Python uses indentation to indicate blocks of code:
- Unlike other languages that use curly braces or keywords like “begin” and “end” to indicate blocks of code, Python uses indentation.

# Python is dynamically typed:
- This means that you don’t need to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it 

# Python uses snake_case for variable and function names:
- In snake_case, words are separated by underscores 

# Python has built-in data types:
- such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries:

# Python has a garbage collector:
- that automatically frees up memory that is no longer being used

# Python supports multiple programming paradigms:
- including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming

# Python has a large standard library:
- that provides many useful modules for tasks such as working with regular expressions, sending email, and working with databases.

# Python supports exception handling:
- for dealing with errors that occur during program execution

# Python has a call stack:
- this keeps track of function calls and their parameters.

# Python supports both static and dynamic binding:
-  for method calls

# Python supports both implicit and explicit type conversion:
- also known as casting

# Python has first-class functions:
- which means that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned as values from functions

# Python supports lambda expressions:
- which are anonymous functions that can be defined inline

# Python has a built-in debugger:
- which can be used to step through code and inspect variables at runtime

# Python supports list comprehensions:
- which provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists

# Python supports decorators:
- which are a way to modify the behavior of functions or classes without changing their source code

# Python supports generators:
- which are functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing them to produce a sequence of values over time instead of all at once

# Python supports metaclasses: 
- which are classes that define the behavior of other classes
